    ## Hi my name is Sam!

    My favorite thing to do is laundry, but only when I have an important
    deadline coming up. Otherwise I like to read books and study nuclear
    engineering in my spare time.

    I wrote a beginner's guide to creating a website with GitHub pages
    [here](https://samgdotson.github.io/guides/2020-6-18-websiteguide/)
