In this series of blog posts I will discuss some of the assigned readings
for the [Sustainable Planning Seminar](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/spring/LA/446)
(Urban Planning/Geography/Landscape Architecture 446) at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

This week's readings were:
1. Herman Daly's _Beyond Growth_
2. Kate Raworth's _Donut Economics_ (summarized)
3. A critical review of _Donut Economics_ by Erik Schokkaert
4. A video documentary about _Donut Economics_


What is "Donut Economics?" It's a reconceptualization of human progress, moving
away from a "growth at any cost" mindset to one of sustainability.

The middle of the donut includes basic human rights that, in an ideal economy,
all people would have access to. Raworth calls this the "social foundation."
The outside of the donut is bounded by another region that Raworth calls the
"ecological ceiling" -- past which the economy has overshot the regenerative
capacity of natural systems. The space between these two boundaries is
the "safe and just" space for humanity. This model is a good _qualitative_
measure of economic sustainability. It's also a good mental tool for tracking
the many interdependent issues humanity is facing. Donut economics forces us
to consider equity as an important part of the equation.

The idea of centering ecology and human rights in economic conversations is not
a brand new idea. Herman Daly spelled out several of the same concepts in
_Beyond Growth_. Daly's work is in some ways better because he sought to
move concepts of sustainable development from "pious generalities" into specific
policy actions. This was Schokkaert's main criticism of Raworth's work --
_Donut Economics_ had very little rigor and simply replaced one set of beliefs
with another. It would have been better and more interesting, Schokkaert argued,
if Raworth made concrete suggestions for policy and implemntation rather than
pointing to anecdotes of a "circular economy." As a scientist, I share
Schokkaert's concern about challenges in implementation, and the distinct lack
of discussion about this topic.

Fortunately, Daly made some very cogent arguments on implementation. Daly
believes the best method for achieving a sustainable economy is to internalize
economic externalities. Externalities like damage to communities that do not
benefit from the use of a particular resource, or from chemical pollution.
Daly also uniquely advocated for "nationalist" economic policies. Whereby
developing countries would emphasize domestic production and rely on global
trade only when it is a more efficient choice. Rather than the general advice
to integrate developing nations into the "free market" economy.

My only criticism of Daly is that he seems too optimistic about the political
possibilities for the internalization of "externalities" (e.g. a price on
carbon). _Beyond Growth_ was written in 1996 and aggravatingly little progress
has been made on that front, relative to the scale of the problem.
