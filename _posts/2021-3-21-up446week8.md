In this series of blog posts I will discuss some of the assigned readings
for the [Sustainable Planning Seminar](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/spring/LA/446)
(Urban Planning/Geography/Landscape Architecture 446) at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

This week's readings were:
1. Profitable Solutions for Oil, Climate, and Proliferation by Amory Lovins
2. A selected chapter from _Super Freakonomics_ by Levitt and Dubner.
3. A tax proposal from Thomas Piketty
4. [An article on Carbon Pricing from the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/02/climate/pricing-carbon-emissions.html)
5. [An op-ed by Paul Krugman about resource exploitation.](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/opinion/21krugman.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&ref=paulkrugman&adxnnlx=1298851410-bHIxTDq9CykjceOXR4ZfiQ)
6. ["Opportunity in climate change"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9imy6SUYdw)
7. [Yaron Answers: Capitalism and the Environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsKESen_Ln8)
8. A chapter from _Natural Capitalism_ by Lovins, Lovins, and Hawkins.
9. TED talk from David Keith about geoengineering.

The common thread among these readings was to identify potential, economically
feasible, solutions to the climate (and resource) crisis. Broadly, they were:
1. Carbon pricing (internalizing the cost of pollution) (Piketty, NY Times).
2. Increase economic efficiency (_Muda_ and "Profitable Solutions").
3. Invest in renewable energy because it "creates jobs."
4. Geoengineering to slow climate change (included in the economics portion because
    it is cheap relative to other solutions).

While discussing these solutions, it is critical to keep in mind your own priorities.
Two of my priorities are _actually solving the climate crisis_ and ensuring the
solutions are _equitable_. As I describe below, some solutions (in particular
100% renewable energy) are wholly inconsistent with the priorities claimed by
their advocates.


Now, let's talk about each one in turn.

### Carbon Pricing

Carbon pricing would be an okay solution if it were more aggressive and placed
a higher value on the social cost of carbon. Unfortunately, these plans often pass
the burden to consumers. If the cost of carbon is applied uniformly (i.e. equally),
then the result is greater _inequity_. People that can afford to pay for a carbon
tax can continue to live their lives with relative impunity. People with fewer
resources to begin with will face further restrictions on their basic needs, like
electricity. Piketty's solution that would tax the global North rather than the
global South is a good start but is still a blunt instrument because it doesn't
address inequality (and inequity) _within_ highly developed countries.

### Economic Efficiency

Essentially, reduce waste and bloat in large corporations. Lovins gave the example
of a manufacturing company that invested in complex machines to accelerate and
homogenize a relatively simple task. However, the complex machinery required
more work to maintain than simpler machines that took longer to perform the
task -- thus greater inefficiency. This is a nice idea and makes for better
business, but it doesn't translate well to policy. (Rhetorically) How would you
make sure that all businesses got rid of this kind of inefficiency "waste?"
To me, this strategy falls in the same category as demand reduction efforts. It's
not a reliable solution.

### Investing in Renewable Energy

I am 100\% for investing in clean energy sources, but not at the expense of the
existing nuclear energy fleet. There were several inaccurate or misleading claims
scattered throughout the readings and videos. First, "renewable energy creates
jobs" from the "Finding opportunity" video. The experts this news program
consulted claimed uncritically that renewable energy creates jobs and that people
that work in fossil fuel industries can be retrained to work in clean energy jobs.
_What a load of s**t._

Solar and wind farms have a _fraction_ of the employees that nuclear plants do (which
have more employees than fossil fuel plants). As with energy reliability, the
comparison to nuclear power is not even close.

If creating jobs is an _actual policy goal_ then investing in solar and wind is
clearly not the way to do achieve it. Allowing your nuclear plants to shut down
prematurely (arguably anytime before their 80 years of life) is also clearly a
mistake.

The opportunity for retraining and working in the renewable energy industry, if
a worker manages to secure one of these scarce jobs, still doesn't pay as well
as working in a nuclear plant, which has the _highest_ average pay among any
source of generation.

![Wages by Energy Source](/assets/images/energy-wages.jpeg)

You are lying to yourself if you think renewable energy investment will create
these jobs. I can hear people saying "it creates jobs in other places in the
supply chain." Do you really think nuclear energy, the most sophisticated and
complex mode of energy generation in the world, doesn't have as many or more
"supply chain" jobs as renewable energy? Stop kidding yourself.

My point is simply this: _be honest about your priorities and goals_. You can
advocate for investment in solar and wind energy -- I support that -- but claiming
"job creation" as a benefit is a farse.

The second claim leveled against nuclear power (in these readings) is the risk
for nuclear weapons proliferation. Lovins suggests that relying on nuclear power
is equivalent to choosing "nuclear holocaust" in the list of ways to perish.
Of course I don't want to die in a nuclear explosion nor in a variety of grotesque
ways in the subsequent dystopia. Equating nuclear _power_ and nuclear _weapons_
is a [false comparison](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171106112256.htm).

Similarly, if you want to invest in solar and wind energy you cannot simultaneously
be worried about excessive resource use and "waste." Contrary to renewable energy,
there is a plan for spent nuclear fuel -- it's currently stored in dry casks.
I think dry cask storage is superior to geologic storage because it will be easier
to access if we ever want to recycle the material. Recycling spent nuclear fuel is
absolutely possible, France has been doing it for 40 years.

The calculations for the above plot are mine, if you don't agree with some
of my assumptions you can play around with the numbers yourself in this

### Geoengineering

I'm intrigued by some of the plans that don't involve putting sulfates in the
atmosphere (making clouds with sea water, perhaps?). My only issue is that the
secondary effects of this strategy are unknown.


Notes:
* _Muda_ is an interesting Japanese word for waste.
* The chapter argues for growing the economy by reducing bloat.

---

* "Profitable Solutions" conflates nuclear _power_ with nuclear weapons _proliferation_.
This is an utterly false comparison. The author states: "Micropower thus added four
times the electricity and 11 times the capacity that nuclear power added globally in 2005."
Congratulations? _Capacity_ does not equal _generation_.
* The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has an anti-nuclear bias that makes
their assessments rather fraught.
* Microgrids can benefit from _micro-nuclear reactors_ too! The technology is
possible and will be deployed in the next 5 or so years.

---

* Levitt and Dubner essentially argue in favor of geoengineering to slow or
reverse climate change.

---

* The opportunity in climate change video discusses the potential for job
creation and retraining. According to these individuals investment in clean
energy creates many new jobs and possibilities for retraining. This is completely
false. If job creation was an actual policy goal, there would be more investment
in nuclear power, not renewables like solar and wind [1].
* Not only do renewable energy sources require fewer jobs, they aren't paid as
well as jobs at nuclear plants [2].

---

* The Yaron Brook video was posted by the Ayn Rand Institute. Ayn Rand was an
anti-semite and her individualist philosophy has been used to justify the idea
that poor people are poor due to moral failings and successful people are
successful because they are morally superior. The credibility of the Ayn Rand
Institute is minimal, to me.
* Incredible. Yaron begins by asking "what environment," followed by claims that
technology has made the "human environment" healthier and cleaner that at any
point in history. He _failed_ to ask the other obvious question: for whom? These
same arguments have been repeated elsewhere (e.g. by Alex Epstein in _The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels_)
an they are not at all salient.
* I stopped watching, this guy is an absolute clown. Who supposedly owns the water?
Does everyone have an equal ability to pursue damages (a potentially costly process)?
What if I don't agree with how "someone" (a private company, most likely) is
using their "private" resources? Yaron doesn't bother asking nor attempt to
answer these questions. The privatization solution is tremendously inequitable.
