# How much battery storage does Illinois need?

Many recent clean energy proposals focus on transitioning to "100% renewable"
energy. Renewable, in most cases, means intermittent sources like solar and
wind. Illinois has [limited technical potential](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf)
for hydro and geothermal power, so onshore wind and a combination of rooftop
and utility scale solar is required to meet any goal of 100% renewable energy.

Since these energy sources are variable _and_ intermittent, battery storage
is required to fill gaps between electricity supply and demand. But _how much_
battery storage are we talking about?


## Electricity Demand and Reliability Requirements

The [North American Electric Reliability Corporation](https://www.nerc.com/AboutNERC/Pages/default.aspx)
(NERC) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to minimize risks to
grid reliability and security.
