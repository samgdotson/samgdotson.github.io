In this series of blog posts I will discuss some of the assigned readings
for the [Sustainable Planning Seminar](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/spring/LA/446)
(Urban Planning/Geography/Landscape Architecture 446) at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
The readings for this week are numerous:

Tuesday:
- ["No More Mountaintop Removal"](https://vimeo.com/3586182) (video)
- [Mountaintop Removal Coal Mining in West Virginia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfnD6r1MITI&ab_channel=GwenSchantz) (video)
- [Canadian Tar Sands Controversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3oYUxPTQUE&ab_channel=JourneymanPictures) (video)
- [Keystone XL pipeline: Why is it so disputed?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30103078) (article)
- [Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines controversy explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCPWjg-bXTY&ab_channel=TheVerge) (video)
- [Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/) (article)
- [Hedonistic Sustainability](https://www.ted.com/talks/bjarke_ingels_hedonistic_sustainability) (video)


Thursday:
- Gasland (Documentary by Josh Fox)
- [The World's Largest Battery](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/15/620298266/episode-848-the-world-s-biggest-battery) (podcast)

  Most of the readings and videos in this collection are thematically connected by
the environmental impacts of extracting (mountain top removal and hydraulic
  fracturing) and transporting fossil fuels (Keystone and Dakota Access
    pipelines). Design solutions and political actions are also considered in
    Bjarke Ingle's TED talk, "Hedonistic Sustainability," and President Joe
    Biden's Executive Order, and battery storage. <br>
    It's clear that extraction of fossil fuels has negative impacts on the surrounding environment and the health of nearby communities. This fact belies
arguments, like the on in _The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels_ by Alex Epstein,
that increasing access to energy increases GDP and life expectancy. Both claims
may be true on average, but it willfully ignores the people that are hurt by
fossil fuels. I [reviewed](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3523948428?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) this book last year. <br>
  These articles and videos were mostly about material extraction and did not
discuss the environmental impacts of _using_ coal to produce energy. Yes, coal
is an enormous emitter of greenhouse gases, but it is also one of the
greatest sources of excess radiation in the United States. A coal plant release
[100 times more radiation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/) into the environment than a nuclear
plant of a comparable size. <br>
One thing in these readings surprised me-- I hadn't considered that Keystone and DA pipelines could be cancelled on their
own due to poor economics. This makes the withdrawal of their permits feel
somewhat performative on the part of the Biden Administration (not to say
he was wrong to do it). Fortunately the Executive Order did a lot more than just
stop a couple of pipelines. I was bothered by Dan Charles' claim in the NPR
podcast that solving the energy storage problem means you're on your way to
solving climate change. Energy storage is important, but it's not a silver
bullet and, as we observed in Texas last week, we will need a lot more batteries than previously imagined.<br>
Finally, all sources of energy have trade offs. In the case of coal and natural
gas, we are trading cheap and plentiful energy for environmental damage and
climate change. With renewables we trade environmental damage (at the scale of
coal and natural gas, they have their own supply chain issues) for intermittency and vast resource requirements. In the case of solar power, we may
also be trading [forced labor](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/business/economy/china-solar-companies-forced-labor-xinjiang.html) for a chance at a
cleaner environment.
