In this series of blog posts I will discuss some of the assigned readings
for the [Sustainable Planning Seminar](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2021/spring/LA/446)
(Urban Planning/Geography/Landscape Architecture 446) at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
The readings for this week are:
1. IPCC "Summary for Policy Makers"
2. Fourth National Climate Assessment (summary only)
3. Selected chapters from David Orr's book, [_Hope is an Imperative_](https://smile.amazon.com/Hope-Imperative-Essential-David-Orr/dp/1597267007/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=hope+is+an+imperative&qid=1612207940&sr=8-1).


## Summaries

### _IPCC "Summary for Policy Makers"_

Since this document is itself a summary of a much longer report I won't summarize
every conclusion they make here. Instead I'll highlight a few of the items that
I found particularly interesting.
* Combined cycle natural gas plants may be an important technology to transition
away from coal-fired plants.
* Successful mitigation strategies will require changes in end-use demand, not
just changes in energy supply.
* The building sector accounted for almost a third of final energy use. This
is surprisingly low. I have seen other reports indicating that building energy
use is almost two thirds. This is possibly only true in the United States, though.

This figure summarizes the main findings of the report. It's frightening that
even if the strongest mitigation strategies were adopted, it is "more unlikely
than likely" that the Earth will stay below 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

### _Fourth National Climate Assessment_

This report gives a detailed state-of-the-climate for the United States.
Consistent with IPCC findings, the United States is not doing enough to
mitigate climate change. I was impressed by the breadth of its summary findings.
I was particularly impressed that there was a section dedicated to the impacts
of climate change on indigenous peoples. The section on mitigation strategies
was quite short, although the purpose of this document wasn't to evaluate
all possible avenues, but to catalog the changes and impacts caused by the climate
crisis. This makes sense because the climate impacts are myriad. Combined
with the IPCC report, the picture of the future looks very grim.


### David Orr: _"The Carbon Connection"_

This is a chapter (or perhaps an essay) from David Orr's book _Hope is an Imperative_.
In it, he shares vivid descriptions of the damage in Louisiana after Katrina;
small land-owners in North Carolina struggling to keep their property free from
coal mining; and coal companies that couldn't care less about how their actions
impact the climate. The connection is carbon, he says. The climate is not only
being damaged as a side-effect of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but also by humans
actively destroying nature to secure energy resources.


### David Orr: _"2020: A Proposal"_
##### First published: 2000

Orr once again describes the dire situation presented by climate change. He makes
a bold analogy, comparing society's dependence on fossil fuels to slavery. His
claim is that we are mortgaging the futures of subsequent generations. The
eponymous "2020 proposal" is for all universities and schools to adopt aggressive
policies to abolish fossil fuel usage by 2020. This work is prescient.


## Synthesis
---
Taken together, all of these readings create a portrait of our current climate
crisis. The National Climate Assessment (U.S.) explicitly describes
what effects are already being felt, where, and by whom. The IPCC report makes
technical recommendations that could prevent further warming, and thus reduce
environmental harm. David Orr's essays give a more human dimension to the problem
by introducing people from different parts of the United States. His chapter on
the proposal to reduce fossil fuels on university campuses was certainly farsighted
and important. The 2020 proposal preceded the first _Illinois Climate Action Plan_
(iCAP) by a decade and was far more aggressive than that first plan by UIUC. I
don't have any deep or insightful comments about the technical reports. I largely agree
with Orr's assessment that human activity is destroying natural places, habitats,
and ecosystems for myopic reasons. However, his suggestions for
replacing our coal energy trivialized an immensely challenging problem. He mentions
in "Carbon Connection" that we have enough energy resources from renewables to
get off of coal (if only it weren't for those greedy coal companies). His
recommendation to universities was to "[develop] plans to harness renewable
energy sources sufficient to meet campus energy needs by 2020." Followed by "
competent implementation."
I won't go into detail here, since I have written and presented about the UIUC
energy system elsewhere. But renewables are absolutely not enough by themselves.
* The campus is heated by direct steam from Abbott Power Plant, not electricity.
* Producing that heat from renewable sources is incredibly inefficient.
* Up to 60% of campus electricity demand is imported from the MISO grid at any
one time. This is accounts for the majority of campus emissions.

It's a big problem and there is no magic bullet.

## Media and Further Reading

#### DECC 2050 Calculator

For readers curious about what actually needs to go into a successful mitigation
strategy, I encourage you to check out the [DECC 2050 Calculator](http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/#/calculator). This tool gives a good high level view of the problem scale. It
also offers more detailed explanations for each assumption that went into the model.

#### Illinois Climate Action Plan

Read about UIUC's plan to decarbonize by 2050 [here](https://icap.sustainability.illinois.edu/).


#### Illinois Utilities and Production Master Plan

For especially curious and detail oriented readers, you can read the comprehensive
report on energy production and usage from the UIUC Facilities and Services Department,
[here](https://fs.illinois.edu/docs/default-source/utilities-energy/utilities-master-plan_.pdf?sfvrsn=16bbfbea_0).
